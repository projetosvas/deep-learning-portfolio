# Vinicius Amorim - Deep Learning Portfolio with TensorFlow

Welcome to my repository of Deep Learning projects. This space serves as a collection of my work and studies in the field of Artificial Intelligence, with a primary focus on building and training models using the TensorFlow framework and the Keras API.

## About This Repository

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my skills in applying neural networks to solve complex problems across different domains, such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Each project contains a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) or Python script (`.py`) with the complete code, along with detailed explanations of the problem, the methodology used, and the results obtained.
